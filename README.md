# Game of Life

## A C++ console program recreating John Conway's Game of Life.

A work in progress on compatability with different dev environments. Assuming it is running, answer console questions as prompted. Type out a 10 x 10 grid of X's and -'s, separated by spaces, hitting ENTER after each 10 characters. Example:


X - - - X X - - - X

X X - - - - - - X X

X - X - - - - X - X

X - - X - - X - - X

X - - - X X - - - X

X - - - X X - - - X

X - - X - - X - - X

X - X - - - - X - X

X X - - - - - - X X

X - - - X X - - - X


Feel free to copy and paste from bottom comments to save time writing out the grid.

Enjoy,
